                        I hold a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences, a master's degree in Counseling and Student personnel, and currently I am doing the coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. I have always wanted to have a career that had meaning and that will
                        bring joy to people around me. I studied Biology to become a doctor, but changed my mind along the way. I went into Counseling because I hoped to help students be successful in college and live rewarding lives. Now I am studying
                        coding because my husband and I have been talking about starting our own business, and I thought obtaining a certificate in coding will be very beneficial to the success of our business. </p>


                    <p> when I am not working on my career, I spend sometimes with my son Jared who is only 4 months today. I do enjoy supernatural movies/shows, and cry when a movie is sad. I want to be a business owner one day so that I can travel the world
                        and also get some flexibility on my time. </p>


                    <p>As I look forward to the future, I am reminded of where I came from and where I am headed too. I used to believe I needed to be just like everyone else, I used to compare myself with others and cared too much for what they said about
                        me. Today I am a very free spirit and I believe in a redifined version of Karma, I believe one can achieve what ever they set their minds to do, and finally, I believe without faith, I wont get where I want to be. I hope after
                        reading through my portfolio, you will have an idea of who I am. </p>
